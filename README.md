# nlp-write

# This is slightly updated from woolz - This lib uses two Natural Language Processing (Spacy & NLTK) and a online word-finding query engine for developers called datamuse as base to rewrite texts.

#First

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Second

python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

# Third

Create a file called runner.py and run this code:

import nltk
nltk.download()
